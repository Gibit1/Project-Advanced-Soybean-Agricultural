# Project: Advanced Soybean Agricultural|Classification

## Project Overview
This project aims to classify soybean plant characteristics based on various agricultural parameters using machine learning models. The dataset contains 55,450 rows and 13 essential features related to plant growth, productivity, and nutritional value.

## Dataset
The dataset includes key features such as plant height, number of pods, chlorophyll content, protein percentage, seed yield, and relative water content in leaves.

## Objective
The goal is to build a machine learning model that accurately predicts soybean plant characteristics, helping in yield optimization and sustainable farming practices.

## Installation
Clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone <repository_link>
cd soybean-classification
pip install -r requirements.txt
