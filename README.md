# Project: Advanced Soybean Agricultural|Regression

## Project Overview:
This project aims to classify soybean plant characteristics based on various agricultural parameters using machine learning models. The dataset contains 55,450 rows and 13 essential features related to plant growth, productivity, and nutritional value.

## About the Dataset:
Total Records: 
108 (after removing duplicates)

Total Features: 
13 numeric agricultural parameters
Target Variable: Protein Content (PCO) (continuous numeric value)
Data Source: Compiled in 2025 as part of research at the College of Agriculture, University of Tikrit.

Key Features:
üåø Plant Height (PH)
üå± Number of Pods (NP)
üåæ Biological Weight (BW)
‚òòÔ∏è Chlorophyll Content (ChlorophyllA663, Chlorophyllb649)
ü´ò Seed Yield per Unit Area (SYUA)
üçÉ Relative Water Content in Leaves (RWCL)

## Methodology:
1. Data Preprocessing & Cleaning
2. Exploratory Data Analysis [EDA]
3. Feature Engineering
4. Model Training & Evaluation
5. Results & Insights

## Objective:
The primary goal of this project is to develop a regression model that accurately predicts the Protein Content (PCO) in soybean crops based on various agricultural parameters. This will help researchers and farmers:
‚úÖ Estimate protein levels in different soybean varieties.
‚úÖ Optimize farming techniques to enhance soybean nutritional value.
‚úÖ Identify key features that influence protein content.

To achieve this, we will:
1Ô∏è‚É£ Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand feature relationships.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Apply feature engineering and preprocessing techniques.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Train multiple regression models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, etc.).
4Ô∏è‚É£ Evaluate model performance using Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R¬≤ Score.
5Ô∏è‚É£ Optimize the best model using cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning.
